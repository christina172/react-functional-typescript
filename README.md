Internship 2023 - Using React Router, fetching and displaying data with functional components using TypeScript

This app (created using create-react-app) fetches all characters and locations from the Rick and Morty API. There is a Router set up with 2 routes (home route for displaying characters and /locations route for displaying a list of locations). The data is split into 42 pages (20 characters per page) and 7 pages (20 locations per page) respectively. At the bottom of the page there are buttons to navigate to the previous or the next page. The names of the characters are displayed along with their profile pictures and locations are just a list of their names. Everything is done using functional components and hooks and written in TypeScript. Styles are added using regular css in one file. This is a modified version of the previous project react-class-components.
